    "description": "Tom and Jerry as you've never seen them before! With a fresh new look that was born and bred in Asia, they are ready for their adventures in the region. Starting off with Singapore, Tom and Jerry chase each other through the Marina Barrage, Joo Chiat or Bishan Park. Look out also for the Singapore River or your favourite HDB estate! Totally at home with our balmy weather because like true blue Singaporeans, they know exactly how to cool down. Their \"kiasu\" ways come in handy too as they make a new friend with Merli.",
